1. INTRODUCTION TO THIS GUIDANCE 
 
Introduction to Abu Dhabi Global Market  
 
Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM) is a broad based international financial centre, established pursuant 
to Abu Dhabi Law No. 4 of 2013 in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi. With its own civil and commercial laws 
based on the English common law, ADGM offers the local, regional and international business 
community a world-class legal system and regulatory regime.  
About this guidance 
This guidance is prepared to support Controllers and Processors in complying with the applicable 
provisions in the ADGM Data Protection Regulations 2021 (DPR 2021) regarding the processing of 
specific categories of sensitive data, also referred to as ‘special categories of data.’  The DPR 2021 
requires ADGM Licensed Persons to establish a separate policy document known as an ‘Appropriate 
Policy Document’ (“APD”) in cases where a Controller processes certain special categories of 
personal data.  
Who the guidance is aimed at 
This guidance applies to ADGM Licensed Persons who collects and processes special category of 
personal data and has day-to-day responsibility for personal data. It is aimed at small and medium 
enterprises although it may also be useful for larger organisations and their legal advisors. 
 Further details are available in relation to the ADGM DPR 2021 requirements in Part 1 of this 
Guidance.  
What the guidance does 
This guidance aims to explain what the APD is and how it may apply to your processing activities. 
This guidance includes a template to help you ask the right questions, and understand your obligation. 
However, the ultimate responsibility of how to do and how to justify decisions remains with the firm. 
This is a key principle of the DPR 2021, known as the accountability principle. 
What are special categories of personal data? 
Certain types of personal data, known as special categories or personal data, receive additional 
protection under the DPR 2021 because they are more sensitive.  The DPR 2021 defines the following 
as special categories of personal data:  
 
 personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin ; 
 personal data revealing political opinions ; 
 personal data revealing religious or philosophical beliefs ; 
 genetic data ; 
 biometric data  (where used for identification purposes); 
 data concerning health; 
 data concerning a person’s sex life or sexual orientation; 
 personal data relating to criminal convictions and offences or related security measures .

VER1.0-05082021 NOTE: You can only process special categories of personal data if one of the conditions 
set out in Article 7(2) of the DPR 2021 applies.  For more information about the lawful 
basis for processing see Part 1 of the DPR 2021 Guidance. 
 
2. THE REQUIREMENT 
 
What does the law say? 
Article 7(3) of the DPR 2021 states that: 
Where it is specified  that a condition in section 7(2) is met only if the Controller has an 
appropriate policy document in place, the Controller will have an appropriate policy 
document in place if: (a) the policy document (which may incorporate other documents by 
reference) explains, for Personal Data Processed in reliance on the condition:  
(i) how the Controller will comply with the principles in section 4; and  
(ii) the Controller’s policies regarding the retention and erasure of that Personal Data; and 
(b) from the date the Controller starts to Process Personal Data in reliance on the 
condition until 6 months after the Controller ceases to carry out such Processing, 
the policy document referred to in section 7(3)(a) is:  
(i) retained, reviewed and updated (as appropriate); and  
(ii) made available to the Commissioner of Data Protection on request. 
 
What specified conditions require an APD? 
Section 7(2) of the DPR 2021 sets out the conditions that require Controllers to have an APD in 
place. 
 
An APD is required where the processing of special category is:  
 
 Necessary for the purposes of carrying out the obligations and exercising specific rights of the 
Controller or of the Data Subject in the field of employment law. 
 
 Necessary for reasons of substantial public interest in: 
 
 (i) the exercise of a function or requirement conferred on a person by Applicable Law;  
 
 (ii) the exercise of a function of the Board, Abu Dhabi or United Arab Emirate government; 
 
 (iii) the administration of justice;  
 
 (iv) equality of opportunity or treatment provided that the Processing does not, or is not 
likely to, cause substantial damage or substantial distress to an individual; and it does not 
relate to an individual who has given written notice to the Controller not to Process their 
  Appropriate Policy Document
   
Page 4 of 10 
 
VER1.0-05082021 Personal Data; 
 
 (v) diversity at senior levels of organisations, where the Controller cannot reasonably be 
expected to obtain the Consent of the Data Subject and is not aware of the Data Subject 
withholding Consent provided that the Processing does not, or is not likely to, cause 
substantial damage or substantial distress to an individual;  
 
 (vi) the prevention or detection of an unlawful act or omission where the Processing must 
be carried out without the Consent of the Data Subject so as not to prejudice this purpose; 
and if the Processing relates to the disclosure of Personal Data to a relevant public 
authority; 
 
 (vii) the protection of the members of the public against dishonesty, malpractice or other 
seriously improper conduct, unfitness or incompetence, mismanagement in the 
administration of a company, body or association, or failures in services provided by a 
company, body or association where the Processing must be carried out without the 
Consent of the Data Subject so as not to prejudice this purpose;  
 
 (viii) compliance with, or assisting other persons to comply with, a regulatory requirement 
which involves a person taking steps to establish whether another person has committed 
an unlawful act or omission, or been involved in dishonesty, malpractice or other seriously 
improper conduct where the Controller cannot reasonably be expected to obtain the 
Consent of the Data Subject to the Processing;  
 
 (ix) the prevention of fraud in connection with Processing of Personal Data as a member 
of, or in accordance with arrangements made by, an antifraud organisation;  
 
 (x) the disclosure in good faith to an appropriate public authority regarding suspected 
terrorist financing, to identify terrorist property or in relation to suspected money 
laundering, in accordance with Applicable Law;  
 
 (xi) the publication of a judgment or other decision of a court or tribunal or if the Processing 
is necessary for the purposes of publishing such a judgment or decision. 
 
What about the other conditions? 
 
An APD is not required in all instances where there is processing of special category of personal 
data. Where the condition does not specify a need for an APD, you do not need one. You may still 
choose to develop one for your own governance and record-keeping. 
 
How does this differ from the mandatory Record of Processing Activity (RoPA)?  
 
The ADP complements the mandatory register of processing activity. The record of processing 
encompasses and captures  all processing activities within your organisation. The RoPA activity would 
be useful in identifying those special category data covered by the above requirement for an APD. 
The APD is a standalone policy that is required for demonstrating accountability. The APD must be 
made available to data subjects and the Office of Data Protection.

category of data, you also require a condition in Article 7 of the DPR 2021. For more information, please
